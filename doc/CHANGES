 * smart spin mode like the LiveGraphics3D
 * Depth queing for the wireframe style
 * can POST a image as a png file (like the ChemDraw applet)

 * now can pick a information of molecular - distance,angle,torsional angle
 * hot-keys are renamed for easy access

 * fixed clipping bug
 * the 'mode' parameter added to chose a rendering method
   (ball&stick, sticks, wireframe, spacefill)
 * specular rendering enabled
 * the 'molstring' parameter added.
   (a pdb file can be embedded like the JME way)
 * a local file can be opened by the 'model' parameter
 * the rendering speed enhanced by small modification of the DisMol.java

==== version 0.12 (7/21/98): =====

 Increased max atom display size from 500 to 750, enabled settingit
 from .html via <param name=atomsize value="nnn">.
 Changed default zoom to reflect size of drawing area.

==== version 0.11 (5/20/98): =====

 Incorporated Will Ware's fix to view.java rotation code.
 Fixed bug that caused bonds to stick out far side of atom at one end.
 Improved centering for views of molecules which aren't centered about 0,0,0.
 Fixed axes so they are hidden by other objects in front of them.
 Added crude Makefile. Everything compliles with -O now.

==== version 0.10 (4/2/98): =====

 Improved performance by eliminating many repetitive memory allocs.
 Disabled threading.
 Fixed bug in reading pdb files with nonstandard alignment (Chem3d?).

==== version 0.09 (4/1/98): =====

 Fixed parse error in PDBGroup.java.
 Added System.gc() call, made CreateMoleculeBonds call conditional
on number of bonds created by CONECT records to improve performance
on Drexler's finalPump96.09.06.pdb (which still takes too long to paint).

==== version 0.08 (3/31/98): =====

 Replaced fillOval/drawOval calls to draw atoms with heavily optimized
code borrowed from RasMol, and did some related performance improvements.
 Fixed bugs in atom info report.

==== version 0.07 (2/25/98): =====

 Fixed another bug in reading input stream when i/o blocked.

==== version 0.06 (2/25/98): =====

 Fixed bug in reading input stream when i/o blocked.

==== version 0.05 (2/24/98): =====

 Performance improvements.

==== version 0.04 (2/24/98): =====

 Added code to figure out where bonds belong.
 Added option to display axes.
 Added control over atomic radii.
 Changed url entry line to pulldown menu.
 Improved some messages.
