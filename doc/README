 DisMol is an applet intended as an easy way to display molecules that
are on the web, and allow the user to rotate/zoom the display.
 It was put together by Peter McCluskey from code from Will Ware's NanoCAD
and Roger Sayle's RasMol.
 If you're willing to do a little work installing RasMol, you can get much
better control over how you see molecules with RasMol than with DisMol.
